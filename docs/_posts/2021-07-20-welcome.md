Welcome to the Web hosting site for the Doane Center for Computing in the Liberal Arts
(CCLA) High-Performance Computing (HPC) workshop. This workshop is designed for 
students and researchers, who have some programming experience, and who want to 
decrease the amount of time their code takes to run. 

We assume that you have some experience with Python, and will include some examples
in C++ as well. 

This site will contain information about 

* How to optimize Python code 
* How to utilize automatic multi-core parallelism using OpenMP
* How to begin to write distributed parallel code to run on supercomputers, using OpenMPI

New blog posts will be uploaded as more of the site is completed. 

The first addition to the site is some tips for [optimizing Python code](../pages/optimizing-python-overview/index.html): [using built-in functions](../pages/optimizing-python-built-ins/index.html) and pre-written libraries whenever possible,
and building new lists with [list comprehension](../pages/optimizing-python-list-comprehension/index.html) instead of `for` loops.
