Our latest addition to the Doane Center for Computing in the Liberal Arts
(CCLA) High-Performance Computing (HPC) workshop is another entry in the 
"optimizing Python" series. In this lesson, we cover the use of 
[*aliases*](../pages/optimizing-python-function-alias/index.html)
to avoid repeatedly looking up functions that reside in modules or libraries
we import. Using an alias instead of the dot (`.`) inside loops could 
make your code twice as fast!

If you are not already familiar with these optimization tips, it would be 
helpful to look at these lessons before diggin in to the aliases lesson.
