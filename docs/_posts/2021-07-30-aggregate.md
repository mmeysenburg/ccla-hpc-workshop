Our latest addition to the Doane Center for Computing in the Liberal Arts
(CCLA) High-Performance Computing (HPC) workshop is another entry in the 
"optimizing Python" series. In this lesson, we discuss using functions 
that operate on entire lists, rather than on elements of a list, i.e., 
[*aggregate functions*](../pages/optimizing-python-function-aggregate/index.html).

If you are not already familiar with these optimization tips, it would be 
helpful to look at these lessons before digging in to the aliases lesson.

* [list comprehension](../pages/optimizing-python-list-comprehension/index.html)
* [using aliases](../pages/optimizing-python-function-alias/index.html)
