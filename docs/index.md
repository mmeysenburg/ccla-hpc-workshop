This site contains resources to help you write code that runs more
quickly. Content will be added periodically, and each new addition
will be accompanied by a new blog post. Or, you can access the lessons 
via the dropdown navigation menu. If you would like to start at the beginning,
check out the first lesson, [Optimizing Python](pages/optimizing-python-overview/index.html).
