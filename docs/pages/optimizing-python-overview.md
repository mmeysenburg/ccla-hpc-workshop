subtitle: Need to speed your code? Start here!

If you have running Python code that correctly solves your problem,
congratulations! That's most of the battle. If you need to make the
code do its job faster, then this page is the place to begin. 

Python is an _interpreted_ language, as opposed to languages like 
Fortran, C, or C++, which are _compiled_ languages. (Java is somewhere
in between - Java code is compiled to _bytecode_, that is executed on 
a virtual machine that is running on the "bare metal" of your computer.)
