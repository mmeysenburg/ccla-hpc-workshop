My name is Mark Meysenburg, and I have been a professor here at Doane since the 
fall of 1998. I have taught a wide variety of classes, including programming, data structures and algorithms, the theory of computation, computer networking, and software engineering. I also teach a section of our first-year liberal arts seminar every fall. In addition, I have taught in the Doane Adventure Zone program in the summer.
